Write a program to solve the following problem. Please provide the
source code as well as any additional data (e.g. tests), files
(e.g. build scripts) or information (e.g. assumptions you've made,
known bugs, etc.) that you think we should have. Please donâ€™t send
executable code, as this will be blocked by our mail-servers. Your
code should be of a sufficient quality that it can run on a live
business-critical system.

You have a text file where each line consists of an operator followed
by a colon followed by a comma-separated list of numbers. For each
line perform the operation on the numbers and print the results. The
valid operators are 'SUM', 'MIN', 'MAX' and 'AVERAGE'.

E.g. for the file

SUM: 1, 2, 3
MIN: 4, 3, 2

your program should print:

SUM: 6
MIN: 2
